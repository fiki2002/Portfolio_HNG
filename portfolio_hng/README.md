## Codebase Description
The codebase is completely written with Flutter and Dart.
It is well structured with the lib folder housing the main features of the project,
the lib folder is made of the theme and views folder,
The theme folder contains the app's color and images class.
The views folder contains the screens of the app alongsides their components.

## Design Description

The app was designed by Mister Ayoposi Otubanjo (https://www.behance.net/Ayoposi).
Though i later made so changes to it while writing the code
The app is just a simple app with easy navigation through pages.
## Libraries Description
The Libraries used in the app are:
  - Google_Fonts
- Flutter_svg
- Screen_utils
- url_launcher

 ## Google_Fonts

 I used this package to achieve the fonts the designer used in the UI, instead of going through the stress of downloading the fonts on the web which could be hard to find.
 It's a lifesaver.

  ## Flutter_svg

  I used this package to display my icon as that keeps memory than a .png

 ## Screen_utils
 I used screen utils to maintain responsiveness in the app

 ## url_launcher
 
 I used url_launcher to aid in the implementation of the linking of the social media 


## Features I would love to add

If i had enough time, i would implement the multi language feature and enhance the UI a bit

## Challenges i faced

Linking the icons to their respective social media platform was big issue for me, but after some youtube and stack overflow research i was able to get it right
